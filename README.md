## Introduction and Problem Statement:

Airline companies operate in a highly competitive industry where customer satisfaction and operational efficiency directly impact revenue, brand reputation, and loyalty. Dano Airlines commissioned this analysis to understand:


•	Why customer satisfaction levels are low.

•	How delays and service quality affect customer experiences.

•	Which areas of service require urgent improvement.

•	How different customer segments (business/personal travel, first-time/returning, class types) perceive the airline.


The goal is to identify drivers of dissatisfaction and provide actionable insights that can help Dano Airlines improve customer experience, reduce dissatisfaction, and increase on-time performance.

## Key Metrics (KPIs):

- What is the overall satisfaction rate?

- What is the overall dissatisfaction rate?

- What is the net satisfaction score?

- Which service scored highest?

- Which service scored lowest?

- How many flights were delayed?

- What percentage of flights arrived on time?
  
These KPIs reflect both customer sentiment (satisfaction/dissatisfaction) and operational performance (punctuality, delays).


## Skills and Concepts Demonstrated

•	Data Cleaning & Preparation (handling inconsistencies in survey/flight data).

•	Exploratory Data Analysis (finding trends by travel type, class, and customer type).

•	Data Visualization (designing interactive Power BI dashboard).

•	Dashboard Design & Storytelling (presenting KPIs, charts, slicers clearly).

•	Analytical Communication (translating metrics into business insights).

 ## Dashboard Analysis (Interpretation):
 
### KPIs:

•	Overall Satisfaction (43.4%) vs Dissatisfaction (56.6%) → More customers are dissatisfied than satisfied, a red flag.

•	Net Satisfaction (–13.1%) → Negative score means dissatisfaction outweighs satisfaction.

•	Best Service Score (3.2) vs Worst Service Score (2.7) → Indicates inconsistency in service quality; no area exceeds an average rating.

•	Late Flights (414K) → High number of delays, likely the main driver of dissatisfaction.

•	On-Time Arrivals (77.2%) → While above industry minimum standards, the remaining 22.8% delays are hurting customer sentiment.

### Slicers:

•	Customer Type (First-time vs Returning) → Allows drilling into whether dissatisfaction is concentrated in loyal vs new customers.

•	Type of Travel (Business vs Personal) → Helps compare business travelers’ expectations vs leisure travelers.

•	Class (Business, Economy Plus, Economy) → Compares satisfaction levels across fare classes.

•	Delay Category (On-Time, Moderate, Severe) → Filters how different delays affect customer satisfaction.

### Charts:

- Top 3 Areas for Service Improvement (Leg Room, Check-in Service, Cleanliness)
  
    - Passengers highlight these as the weakest areas.

- Leg room and cleanliness are often linked to comfort and brand perception.

- Travel Type vs Satisfaction Rate
  
    - Business travelers report much higher satisfaction than personal travelers.
  
    - Personal travel customers feel underserved.

- Impact of Delay Category on Satisfaction
  
   - Severe delays cause the sharpest drops in satisfaction.
  
   - Even moderate delays negatively impact perceptions.
  
- Class vs Satisfaction Rate
  
   - Business class customers are the most satisfied.
  
   - Economy Plus moderately satisfied.
  
   - Economy class reports the lowest satisfaction.
  
- Customer Type vs Satisfaction Rate
  
  - First-time customers show relatively higher satisfaction.
  
  - Returning customers are more dissatisfied → loyalty is eroding.

- Top 3 Highest-Rated Services (In-Flight Service, Baggage Handling, Seat Comfort)
  
  - These are relative strengths for Dano Airlines.
  - Shows where the company can build competitive advantage.

## Conclusion: 

The analysis reveals that Dano Airlines is facing a customer satisfaction crisis:

•	More than half of passengers (56.6%) are dissatisfied.

•	Service quality issues (leg room, check-in, cleanliness) combine with operational delays (414K late flights) to create a negative perception.

•	Personal and economy class travelers feel underserved, while business class travelers are more satisfied.

•	Returning customers report more dissatisfaction than first-time customers, showing a customer retention problem.


## Recommendations:

- Improve Punctuality
  
   - Reduce flight delays through better scheduling, fleet maintenance, and ground operations.

   - Even moderate delays harm satisfaction — priority must be punctuality.
  
-	Address Top Service Weaknesses
  
   - Increase leg room (where feasible, even small adjustments matter).
 	
   - Improve cleanliness standards on aircraft.
 	
   - Streamline check-in process (digital check-in, staff training).
 	
- Strengthen Economy Class Experience
  
   - Focus on comfort and service for economy passengers, since they make up the bulk of travelers.
  
- Customer Retention Focus
  
   - Introduce loyalty rewards or better experiences for returning customers, to reduce dissatisfaction erosion.
  
- Leverage Strengths
  
   - Market strong areas like in-flight service and baggage handling to attract new customers.
  
- Targeted Service Design
  
   - Personal travelers are less satisfied than business travelers → develop tailored experiences for leisure customers          (family seating, affordable add-ons).
